# Unmock Community Gitter

[![Chat on Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter.png)](https://gitter.im/unmock/community)

This repository contains the script that initializes the Unmock Community Gitter on our [website and documentation](https://www.unmock.io/).

## Why Gitter?

We want to be transparent about our plans and road maps for the Unmock SDKs and tooling. So we decided to create a Gitter to host our conversations about development and make decisions in the open. Our hope is that our collaborators and community members will feel comfortable taking part of these conversations as well.

## Getting involved

If you have questions or you're interested in getting involved with the development of Unmock, you can reach out to us on the [Unmock Community Gitter](https://gitter.im/unmock/community). One of the maintainers will respond as soon as possible! 

Please note that our Gitter community is governed by the [Meeshkan Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/meeshkan/code-of-conduct). By participating, you agree to abide by its terms.
